# WebDevProject
Welcome to our school web development project. 
This will be an on going project while we learn more things 
we'll be updating our website and so on.

1. For our first version we need to use HTML AND CSS. 
The website will be consisted by 4 tabs.The first one will be the "Home page" with some information about each person who's working on the company.
The second one will be the "project" which will be consisted by the information of our most recent project.
The third one will be the "Biography" tab in which will be further information about each person.
And lastly the fourth tab will be "Communication" which will have information about contacting each and every one of us.

All written in HTML and styled in CSS.

In this project we learned mostly how to use git and github but also we worked as a team so we can make it to the end.
